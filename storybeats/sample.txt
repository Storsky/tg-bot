Page 1 (Long shot of jeep)
It's been a while since I have taken a vacation.
I am driving my jeep.
Heading towards the quiet resort town of Silent Hill, the sound of the engine 
reverberates in the darkness.
Due to some slight car trouble earlier, it has become this late.

Page 2 (Harry in jeep)
I am Harry Mason.
I am a run of the mill writer.

Page 3 (Cheryl in jeep)
Her eyes closed, Cheryl sleeps peacefully in the passenger seat.

Cheryl is my daughter.

She is cheerful and lively, and the occasional carefree smiles she shows me 
make me feel happy.

Page 4
I don't have very many relationships with people because of what I do for a 
living, so Cheryl's existence has become irreplaceable to me.
Cheryl was very much looking forward to this trip.

Page 5 (Harry in jeep)
Although paved, this is still very much a mountain road.
At this hour there is little reason for any other drivers to be about.
I push in the accelerator.
There is no light off in the darkness.
I can depend only on my headlights.

Page 6 (Cybil on motorcycle)
Light reflects off the rear view mirror.
It's a motorcycle.
There is a motorcycle headed toward the same destination as we are at terrific 
speed at this late hour.
With a roar the motorcycle effortlessly passes by the side of my jeep.

Page 7
The seal of the police...
Perhaps there has been an accident or something?
But I don't recall hearing about an accident or anything on the radio.

Page 8 (Cheryl in jeep)
Cheryl is sleeping.
A child should not be awake at this hour.
I wonder if she is dreaming about something?
Tomorrow I have planned to take her to the amusement park.
Maybe she is dreaming about riding the merry-go-round?

Page 9 (Harry in jeep)
I glance over at Cheryl's sleeping face and then return my eyes forward.
The lighted area of the road almost appears to be belched out from the 
darkness as it moves toward me.
Huh? Something enters my field of view.

Page 10 (Fallen motorcycle)
It's the motorcycle from just before.
It is lying on its side on the shoulder of the road.
No doubt about it, it's the same motorcycle that just passed me.
There is no sign of the driver. It looks like the driver smashed into the
surface of the rocks by the side of the road while trying to avoid some kind
of obstacle, and thus that part of the motorcycle has been destroyed.

Page 11 (Road)
I carefully check the way in which my vehicle is headed.
However, I don't see anything that could be an obstacle to my advance in the 
area illuminated by the headlights. A strange atmosphere creeps in around me.
The radio reception begins to become erratic.

Page 12 (Harry in jeep)
Perhaps I should turn back? But my foot persistently pushes down the 
accelerator with no intention of letting off.

"You can no longer turn back now..."
Something murmurs within me.

"Please increase your speed some more..."
Someone murmurs within me.

Page 13 (Cheryl in jeep)
Cheryl's eyes are closed.
She is dreaming.
I know that I should be awake.
But what is this uneasy feeling?
I feel as if my body is not totally my own.
It's like someone, some strange being that is not me, is controlling 
me...like I am floating.

Page 14
My eyelids are heavy. As the steering wheel leaves my hand it creates the 
illusion of setting the course on its own.
Freezing cold...
Uneasiness...
Almost like being ready to fall asleep, I am just barely conscious, and now at 
my limit to maintain even that.

Page 15 (Harry with his hand off the steering wheel)
"Ah......"

Page 16 (Girl-like figure in front of the jeep)
When I saw the human figure on the road I cut the wheel hard, and then there 
was nowhere else for my jeep and I to go but down into the darkness below the 
cliff.


Go to 1-1

Chapter 1   "Arrival"
Harry wakes up in his jeep

Page 1 (Black)
The silence pierces my ears.

As the wind blew, it was accompanied by piercing cold.
Where am I? I can feel light faintly passing through my 
eyelids.

Page 2
I don't seem to be hurt.
That much is clear to me because I don't feel any pain in my body.
No, perhaps I've suffered an injury that doesn't cause any pain?

Page 3
I...slowly try opening my heavy eyelids.

第一章　　「到着」
「季節外れの雪」
Chapter 1   "Arrival"
Out of season snow

Page 4 (Harry in wrecked jeep)
Out of season snow is pouring into the town.
Other than the sound of droplets of ice hitting the ground, there is nothing 
else to be heard.

"Silent Hill"
That is what is assuredly written on the sign by the side of the road. Without
realizing it, Cheryl and I have reached our destination.

Page 5
All my memories up to that point are gone.
The wind is blowing in...
When I take a look next to me, I am shocked.

Page 6 (Empty seat of jeep)
The passenger door has been left open.
Cheryl is nowhere to be seen.

第一章　　「到着」
「ゴーストタウン」
Chapter 1   "Arrival"
Ghost Town

Page 7
"Silent Hill."
This town, which should just be a resort area, appears to have become just 
like a ghost town for some reason, or maybe it was waiting for us to 
arrive, or perhaps the town just nestled up to us...

Page 8
So now I am alone.
Cheryl is not here.
While I was sleeping, no, while I was knocked out Cheryl opened the 
passenger door and stepped out "alone" into this tourist spot that is 
ruled by an unsettling silence.

Page 9
And then she left me to head somewhere...

Page 10 (Harry in front of wrecked jeep)
I tightly close my jacket around my neck and set off on foot in 
search of Cheryl.
I wonder what in the world happened here?
Nothing makes any sense.
The silence, the out of season snow...
And strangest of all, the entire town is wrapped in a thick fog.
