4,Page 5 (Harry in jeep),"Although paved, this is still very much a mountain road.At this hour there is little reason for any other drivers to be about.I push in the accelerator.There is no light off in the darkness.I can depend only on my headlights."
5,Page 6 (Cybil on motorcycle),Light reflects off the rear view mirror.It's a motorcycle.There is a motorcycle headed toward the same destination as we are at terrificspeed at this late hour.With a roar the motorcycle effortlessly passes by the side of my jeep.
6,Page 7,The seal of the police...Perhaps there has been an accident or something?But I don't recall hearing about an accident or anything on the radio.
7,Page 8 (Cheryl in jeep),Cheryl is sleeping.A child should not be awake at this hour.I wonder if she is dreaming about something?Tomorrow I have planned to take her to the amusement park.Maybe she is dreaming about riding the merry-go-round?

10,Page 11 (Road),"I carefully check the way in which my vehicle is headed.However, I don't see anything that could be an obstacle to my advance in thearea illuminated by the headlights. A strange atmosphere creeps in around me.The radio reception begins to become erratic."

12,Page 13 (Cheryl in jeep),"Cheryl's eyes are closed.She is dreaming.I know that I should be awake.But what is this uneasy feeling?I feel as if my body is not totally my own.It's like someone, some strange being that is not me, is controllingme...like I am floating."
13,Page 14,"My eyelids are heavy. As the steering wheel leaves my hand it creates theillusion of setting the course on its own.Freezing cold...Uneasiness...Almost like being ready to fall asleep, I am just barely conscious, and now atmy limit to maintain even that."

1636,Page 45,"I ready my weapon.During the short time between the lighting strikes I fire many bulletsinto the creature's body,"
1637,Page 46,During that short time from when it spreads its large wings and becomesready to strike I do not even think about ceasing my attack.
1638,Page 47,"Cheryl's smile flits through the back of my mind.What was it that she wanted?When we decided to travel to Silent Hill, you were the one to suggest it,right Cheryl?"
1639,Page 48,"Were you called here, or did you wish to come here of your own will?"
1640,Page 49,"Cheryl, I loved you more than anyone, and I still do even now.That is the truth.However, I must bury this creature."
1641,Page 50,"I must make up for the sins that Cheryl took from me.And then, when the final bullet penetrated its body..."
1642,Page 51,"It lost the means to keep its body together, and finally the piecesof its body fell apart and dissolved into the darkness...It was completely gone."
1643,Page 52 (Black),"The large space begins to shake heavily.A loud horrifying noise rises up from the below, and with it my existenceis thrown from dimension to dimension, and I feel pain just being there."
1644,Page 53 (Alessa in burning final area),"Fire has broken out in various places in the area, and I can tell that thisspace as well as the entire town are on the verge of collapsing.Alessa lies on her stomach in the center of the space, and she shows no signof moving from there."
1645,Page 54,She is just protecting her entire body in a bird-like manner. Shedesperately holds out the new life that is just below her abdomen towards me.
1646,Page 55,I run over to Alessa.A pained expression rises on Alessa's face as she hands the newbornbaby to me.
1647,Page 56,"The hell fires burn with force and spread around, and my life is threatened.There is not enough time left to try and rescue Alessa from here."
1648,Page 57,"I hold the baby she gave me tightly to my chest, and begin to run from thistwisting space in search of somewhere safe."
1649,Page 58,"Cybil who was unconscious, regains consciousness, and begins to run behind meto escape from the pit of this mad world."
1650,Page 59,I look back at Cybil.And then...I saw that the largest ball of flames up to this point was closing in behindCybil.
1651,Page 60,"""Watch out!"""
1652,Page 61 (Alessa holding hand up),"The great fireball, which was more that enough to completely burn both ourbodies stopped just above Cybil, as she stood holding her head in her hands."
1653,Page 62,Time has stopped.
1654,Page 63,The small sparks and bits of concrete debris were all frozen in midair. Iwas at a loss for words.
1655,Page 64,"Alessa holds both her hands high up into the air, as if she issupporting the falling wreckage, and her face twists in agony."
1656,Page 65,Alessa and I gazed at each other for a moment.
1657,Page 66,A tear travels down her precious cheek in a single line.
1658,Page 67,(Hurry and escape...)
1659,Page 68,"Exerting the last of her power, Alessa stopped time to save me, Cybil, andthe baby in my arms."
1660,Page 69,"""Alessa..."""
1661,Page 70,"Understood, we won't let your volition go in vain.I make a sign to Cybil with my eyes and then return my gaze forward.And then I began to run with all my might."
1662,Page 71,I do not look back.Why did Alessa entrust this small life born from her at the end to me?I have no idea.
1663,Page 72,But I have a feeling that I am obligated to raise this child.
1664,Page 73 (Staircase to freedom),Behind me an explosion occurs.I run.All I can do is continue to run.

1666,Page 1 (Black),"I finally arrived at the deepest level of the otherworld.Inside the door it is wide, and the floor is a metal grating. It is filledwith an evil atmosphere.Additionally, it is accompanied by a strong power that I have not felt before."
1667,Page 2,"The ceiling is too high for me to see.This is a giant space, so large that I cannot tell if I am outside or not."
1668,Page 3,"I carefully walk into the large space, one step at a time.All the answers I seek are probably in this room."
1669,"Page 4 (Dahlia, Alessa, and Cheryl in final area)",Dahlia and Alessa.It is definitely those two.
1670,Page 5,"""I was shocked to realize the talisman of Metraton was being used.In spite of the lost soul returning at last. Just a little longer and allwould have been for naught."

1673,Page 8,"""Stop this! Dahlia!""Dahlia shows no compunction or surprise, and turns to face me with a calmexpression on her face."
1674,Page 9,"""Well, well, well. To think you'd make it this far.""""Where's Cheryl!? What have you done to her!?"""
1675,Page 10,"""What are you talking about?You've seen her many times?Restored to her former self.""""I'm in no mood for jokes.""I didn't understand what she was saying."
1676,Page 11,"""Don't you see? She's right there.""Right there?Only Alessa, draped in her blue clothing, is where Dahlia is pointing."
1677,Page 12,"""That's absurd.""""You are the only one who thinks so.""""Why? Why are you doing this?"""
1678,Page 13,"""It's been a long seven years...For the seven years since that terrible day, Alessa has been kept alive,suffering a fate worse than death."
1679,Page 14,Alessa has been trapped in an endless nightmare from which she neverawakens.He has been nurtured by that nightmare.Waiting for the day to be born.That day has finally come.The time is neigh.

1686,Page 21 (Red bottle in black bag),The item that Kaufmann pulled out of his pocket...It is definitely the small bottle that I found in the gas tank of themotorcycle that was in that garage somewhere.
1687,Page 22,"""Aglaophotis! I thought I got rid of that!""""All I had to do was plant it somewhere for you to find. You, all, well, itkept you busy.Ha! You're easy! And there's more where this came from!"""
1688,Page 23 (Black),"""Stop it!!""Kaufmann throws the small bottle at Alessa.All four of us watch the bottle fly in a beautiful parabola, our eyesfixed on the sacred liquid within."
1689,Page 24,"There is tension.Although she is normally calm and composed, that drug is enough to frightenDahlia.That small bottle hit a part of Alessa's body, shattered into pieces, andsoaked Alessa uncomfortably with the red liquid that was inside."
1690,Page 25 (Alessa with red stained clothes in final area),"Dahlia looks completely emaciated as she watches the whole thing.However, not me, nor anyone could have predicted the situation that came outof that event.(Incubus is born)"
1691,Page 26 (Black),"Alessa's back splits open, and a giant creature the likes of which I havenever seen before tears through the cloth of the one piece dress Alessa iswearing. It looks like an insect breaking out of its cocoon as it is beingborn."

1693,Page 28,"""Huh? What the!?""I yell out, not addressing anyone in particular.""What on earth? That's not supposed to...""Kaufmann just stands there in utter amazement, as the eventsunfold unlike how he had expected."
1694,Page 29,"""It's awakening!It's awake!Now no one can interfere!""Dahlia, in a fit of insanity, had a feeling that could not be describedas pleasant or angry."

1696,Page 31 (Black) (Cheryl appears),"I edge up to Alessa, the mother's body that has been cast off.And there I see Cheryl, about to fade away as always."
1697,Page 32 (Black) (Cheryl walks away),"""Thank you Daddy. Goodbye""I am certain that is what she said to me.""Cheryl?Can't be?You can't leave like this..."""
1698,Page 33,Cheryl is already beginning to run away from me.
